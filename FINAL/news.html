        <p>After an incredible customer response from our previous update, we have
        addressed the issue of Girl #2's character description. Again, her name will not
      be changed. However, we acknowledge that the statement, "Nyan nyan~ OWO what's this...?"
      in her description was inappropriate and uncalled for. We have handled the writer of the
      statement accordingly and apologise for any inconvenience. Thank you for your continued support.</p>

        <h1>2/28/18</h1>

        <h1>2/18/18</h1>
        <p> After several notices from our clients, the art for Girl #1 has been fixed!
        The picture no longer diplays only half of her body, but the full body picture.
      We will not change her name. Our team strongly believes that Girl #1's incredibly meaningful
    name adds to the story and makes for a meaningful experience. Thank you for your continued support!</p>
