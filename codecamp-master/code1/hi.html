            Cranel, a 15-year-old solo adventurer under the goddess Hestia.
            As the only member of the Hestia Familia, he works hard every day
            in the dungeon to make ends meet while seeking to improve himself.
            He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman
            who once saved his life, and with whom he fell in love. He is
            unaware that several other girls, deities and mortals alike, also
            develop affections towards him; most notably Hestia herself, as he
            also gains allies and improves himself with each new challenge he
            faces. </p>
