        <p class = "wow fadeInLeft"> A long, long time ago, the land of Altea
        was ruled by a cruel Demon King and the land was consumed with darkness.
        People lived in fear of the monster and day to day they suffered, wondering
        how long they would live. It was then that a hero appeared, with a sacred sword
        in hand. Along with his companions, the hero used the sword to seal the Demon King
      away, and peace was returned to the land. <br> </br>
        Now, a thousand years later, Altea is a prosperous and lively kingdom. It is
      tradition for those at the age of sixteen to set off on a journey, just as the ancient
    hero once had. Our protagonist, Dennis, is prepared to set off on a journey just like
    all of the others before him. But when he is joined a amnesiac girl who wields an
    unknown power, sinister forces begin to move behind the scenes of what once appeared to
  be a glorious, upstanding kingdom... <br> </br>
  A millennium-old power reawakens, and a new adventure springs forth from the secrets of the past.
  Join Dennis as he experiences a journey extremely similar to that of a typical JRPG and discover
a never-before-seen world!  </p>
