        <p class = "story-description"> The story follows the exploits of Bell
            Cranel, a 15-year-old solo adventurer under the goddess Hestia.
            As the only member of the Hestia Familia, he works hard every day
            in the dungeon to make ends meet while seeking to improve himself.
            He looks up to Ais Wallenstein, a famous and powerful swordswoman
            who once saved his life, and with whom he fell in love. He is
            unaware that several other girls, deities and mortals alike, also
            develop affections towards him; most notably Hestia herself, as he
            also gains allies and improves himself with each new challenge he
            faces. </p>

        <h2> Meet: </h2>
        <p> Studying hard to become a doctor, Kei Nagai is a high schooler who
           knows very little about Ajin, only having seen them appear in the
            news every now and then. Students are taught that these creatures
            are not considered to be human, but Kei doesn't pay much attention
            in class. As a result, his perilously little grasp on this subject
             proves to be completely irrelevant when he survives an accident
              that was supposed to claim his life, signaling his rebirth as
              an Ajin and the start of his days of torment. </p>
